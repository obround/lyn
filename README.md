**This is an unfinished compiler**. It implements a state of the art static single assignment algorithm[1] (as of 2021), and has a couple of optimizations, but is mostly unfinished.
The only finished parts are SSA transform, and a couple of optimizations (DIA, LVN, etc). There are no plans to continue working on this project, but it is decently well
documented if you wish to look at it.
